                <h2>{{ site.title }}</h2>
                <P>I'm Vi (pronounced like "eye" but with a V), a bubbly, sweet, and adventurous trans girlfriend experience with an optional kinky, submissive twist. Equal parts whip-smart and whipping girl, I'm fit and athletic, with soft, curly red ringlets and a natural aesthetic that can be hard femme, curious kitten, sexy librarian, cyberpunk hentai seductress, or a fantasy somewhere in between.</p>
                <p>I frequently host at convenient, private incall spaces in NYC üóΩ and Boston. üèôÔ∏è</p>
                <p>While my candy coating comes in a couple flavors that help me seamlessly shape shift between a fun loving hippie at rave festival campgrounds to a smirking pool shark bending over the billiards table, on the inside I love nothing more than being your good girl, a shameless and free-spirited companion with whom it's easy to relax. I'm drawn to the intimacy of sharing myself and learning about others while gazing at skyline views from rooftop lounges just as much as to the thrill of making out in dark corners of the club, or even through the bars of a dungeon cage.</p>
                <p>I'm often rollerblading when in the city, or hiking when in the woods. I'm multilingual, having went to Jewish grade school where I was that soft spoken, nerdy, bookish student reading STEM texts and sci-fi stories (one of my favorite genres). Geeking out together or getting to see your niche competencies always excites me!</p>
                <p>For sweeter cravings, I offer an oasis full of affection, connection, and intimate moments that will make you feel absolutely adored. Let's go to a beach and listen to the waves, get in cold water and then make each other hot, or sail into a sunset like lovers in a movie! Let's cuddle on a balcony and watch a cityscape sparkle in the sky, or go to a comedy show to laugh and get just this side of inappropriately drunk together. I love a fancy cocktail and white tablecloth dinner but I'll smile just as much at a dive bar bending over a pool table and making bets on trick shots, snuggling in the back of a movie theater, or in the kitchen lady-and-the-tramp'ing our way through a home-cooked meal before enjoying bedroom desserts.</p>
                <p>For spicier desires, I relish being a very, very good girl, the kind daddy (or mommy) can spank to make me better! If you're new to taking charge, I can tease out the dominance from you. It's a particular specialty of mine; I want to hear all about your kinks!</p>
                <p>Ultimately, I'm a nice girl who purrs appreciately when she's pet, yet also cheerfully turns naughty when given the right commands.</p>
